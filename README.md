## **Description**

<p align='justify'> 
This React app is a fully animated Movie catalog with applied adaptive design. For filling its content I've utilized TMDB API.</p> 

<p>In the Hero section of the Home page you can watch a trailer of some popular product or get to the Details page by clicking 'Watch now'.</p>

If you scroll down you would find Trending and Top Rated movies and TV series.</p>

<p>By clicking on a movie you'll be directed to Detail page where you'd find all the information about it, trailers as well as similar products.</p>
